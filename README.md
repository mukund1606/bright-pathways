# Bright Pathways

## Overview

Welcome to BrightPathways, a project aimed at helping individuals, particularly senior citizens, find vital services related to old age care, animal shelters, dog and baby adoption centers, and blind schools. Our project consists of both a website and a mobile app, each tailored to provide a seamless experience for users. The website is built using Next.js and styled with Tailwind CSS, while the mobile app is developed in Kotlin. Firebase serves as the backbone for our mobile app's backend services, while the website's backend is developed using "God Speed." In this documentation, we'll provide an extensive overview of the project, its features, and how to get started.

## Project Goals

Our project aims to address several key goals:

1. _Accessibility_: We're dedicated to ensuring that individuals with diverse needs, including the elderly and those with disabilities, can effortlessly access the information and services they require.

2. _Community Engagement_: Our project fosters a sense of community by allowing users to share their experiences, leave reviews, and interact with one another. This not only provides valuable information but also helps build a supportive network.

3. _Support for Charitable Organizations_: We're dedicated to supporting charitable organizations by making it easy for users to donate online and find volunteer opportunities. This contributes to the sustainability of these essential services.

4. _Information and Education_: We provide an extensive resource center filled with educational content, including articles, videos, and guides. This empowers users to make informed decisions about their care or donations.

5. _Data Security and Privacy_: User data security and privacy are paramount to us. By prioritizing these aspects, we aim to build trust and confidence among our users, who can use our platform with peace of mind.

## Website (Next.js)

### Features

- _Real-time Location Services_: Users can find nearby facilities such as old age homes, animal shelters, and more, ensuring they can access services conveniently.

- _User Reviews and Ratings_: The website allows users to leave reviews and ratings for these facilities, fostering community engagement and providing insights for others.

- _Resource Center_: Our extensive resource center is a treasure trove of information, featuring articles, videos, and guides on topics related to senior care, pet adoption, and blindness. This educational content empowers users.

- _Registration for Facilities_: Service providers can register their facilities easily, ensuring that all the necessary details are available for users to discover.

### Getting Started

1. _Clone the Repository_: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine.

2. _Install Dependencies_: In the website directory, install project dependencies using npm install.

3. _Start the Development Server_: Run npm run dev to start the Next.js development server.

4. _Access the Website_: Open your web browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the website.

## Mobile App (Kotlin)

### Features

- _Real-time Facility Locator_: The app provides users with a real-time facility locator, making it easy to find the services they need.

- _User Reviews and Ratings_: Users can access and contribute to facility reviews and ratings.

- _Community Engagement_: The app promotes community engagement by enabling users to share their experiences and recommendations.

- _Accessible Information_: Users can access the extensive resource center for educational content, empowering them to make informed decisions.

- _Donations and Volunteering_: The app facilitates online donations and allows users to discover volunteer opportunities at their chosen organizations.

### Getting Started

1. _Clone the Repository_: Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. _Open in Your Development Environment_: Open the app directory in your preferred Kotlin development environment, such as Android Studio.

3. _Build and Run_: Build and run the app on an Android emulator or physical device.

## Backend

### Mobile App Backend (Firebase)

Firebase serves as the backend for our mobile app, providing a robust infrastructure for various services, including registration and verification of facilities, notifications, and the integrated payment gateway for donations. Firebase ensures real-time data synchronization and a seamless user experience for our mobile app users.

Please note that setting up and deploying Firebase services for the mobile app may vary based on your hosting environment. Ensure that security best practices are followed when deploying these services to protect user data.

### Website Backend (God Speed)

For the website, our backend services are developed using "God Speed". This backend infrastructure is responsible for handling data related to the website, including user reviews, facility registrations, and the resource center. "God Speed" provides the necessary support for the website's functionalities and ensures that users can access the services and information they need.

Setting up and deploying the "GodSpeed" backend services may differ from Firebase and should be handled according to the specific requirements of this technology.

We believe that this combination of Firebase and "God Speed" allows us to offer a comprehensive and seamless experience to our users across both the mobile app and website.
